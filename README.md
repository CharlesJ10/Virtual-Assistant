# Virtual-Assistant

Charlie is a virtual assistant which can greet you with a random greeting, retrieve the date and time, retrieve information of a particular person on Wikipedia, search for keywords on Google and open videos on YouTube. 

Charlie serves as a personal project that improves my python skills and fuels my interest in Artificial Intelligence.
